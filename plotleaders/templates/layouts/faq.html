                On this website, you will learn more about the way people view leadership figures: who comes to their mind?
                Which qualities do they see in those leaders? Who is seen as the most authoritarian leader? The most aspirational?
                The least benevolent? Use our interactive graph to find out!

            <div class="panel-body">
                You can use our app to generate perceptual maps of leadership figures:
                <ol>
                    <li>Pick one variable that will appear on horizontal axis.</li>
                    <li>Pick a second variable that will appear on the vertical axis.</li>
                    <li>Next, you can (but don't have to) pick a third variable to color-code the leaders.</li>
                    <li>Finally, you can decide to include (or not) specific types of leadership figures: politicians, celebrities...</li>
                </ol>
                You can then zoom by drawing a rectangle on the portion of the graph you wish to have a closer look at,
                and double-click to reset the zoom level.

                Data was collected in two waves:
                <ol>
                    <li>A first group of respondents was asked to name their top three leadership figures.</li>
                    <li>A second group of respondents was asked to rate these leaders on different psychological
                        traits such as authority, benevolence, warmth, competence, etc...</li>
                </ol>
                So far, more 2500 persons have participated to the study, thank you to each of them!
